# Objective
My objective for this fork is to nicely see the stationarity concepts being applied to a time-series forecasting problem. Essentially the steps can be broken down into
```
- Removing stationarity i.e. remove the trend aspect (diff)
- Scaling
- Forecasting
- Invert Scaling
- Add the trend
```

# LSTMs
This Repo has explanatory notebooks where LSTMs are applied for various predictive use cases 


### Example 1 :  Time Series Forecasting with LSTMS
In this notebook a step by step explanation is provided in Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs
